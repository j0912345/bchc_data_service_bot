# read this pls
a file called recover_from_crash.txt is missing from here because if it was here, people could hack my bot very easily.
# what to download:
pycord (get the dev version because the normal download is incomplete):  
```
git clone https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord
cd pycord
py -3 -m pip install -U .[voice]
```  
i don't remember if this is needed but in case it is:
```
py -3 -m pip install asyncio
```
